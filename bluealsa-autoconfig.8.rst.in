SYNOPSIS
========

**bluealsa-autoconfig** [*OPTION*] ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

**bluealsa-autoconfig** is a simple program to add and remove ALSA
configuration nodes for **BlueALSA** Bluetooth PCM and CTL devices. It can also
optionally simulate **udev** events on Bluetooth audio device connect and
disconnect.

OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help
    Output a usage message and exit.

-V, --version
    Output the version number and exit.

-B NAME, --dbus=NAME
    BlueALSA service name suffix. This option can be given more than once to
    add support for multiple ``bluealsad(8)`` service instances. The default
    service **org.bluealsa** is always included. For example, the following
    will include into the ALSA configuration PCMs from **org.bluealsa**,
    **org.bluealsa.sink** and **org.bluealsa.source**:
    ::

        bluealsa-autoconfig -B sink -B source

    For more information see the ``--dbus`` option of the ``bluealsad(8)``
    service daemon.

-u, --udev
    Emit a synthesized ``udev`` event on BlueALSA device connect and
    disconnect. The event is signalled *after* all the associated ALSA
    configuration changes have been committed.

    This option may be useful for some applications (e.g. ``kodi(1)``) that do
    not refresh their audio device list unless a soundcard change is signalled
    via ``udev``. See `UDEV EVENT`_ below.

-d, --default
    Include a definition of a PCM that can be used as the ALSA **default** PCM
    and similarly a CTL. These definitions use a BlueALSA bluetooth device when
    connected or a fallback to a soundcard device otherwise. See
    `AUTOMATIC DEFAULT`_ below.

OPERATION
=========

The program must be run as ``root`` to gain the necessary privileges for
modifying the global ALSA configuration and triggering udev events.

For example, ``aplay -L`` might produce output such as:
::

    bluealsa:DEV=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,PROFILE=a2dp,SRV=org.bluealsa
        Jabra MOVE v2.3.0 A2DP (aptX)
        Bluetooth Audio Output

The generated configuration consists of ``namehint`` nodes which associate a
description with each connected BlueALSA PCM. The content of the description
is configurable - see `DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE`_ below.

DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE
====================

The text used in a PCM description is defined by a key in the global ALSA
configuration: ``defaults.bluealsa.namehint``. The value is a string which can
contain substitutions that are expanded for each PCM. The available
substitutions are:
::

    %a	bluetooth address in format "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
    %c	codec
    %l	newline
    %n	device name (alias)
    %p	profile
    %s	stream direction ("Input" | "Output")
    %%	literal '%'

The text can contain at most one newline which applications such as `aplay`
will use to break the displayed description over two lines. However, be aware
that some other applications, particularly GUI applications, do not always
render the newline very well.

The default description definition is:
::

    defaults.bluealsa.namehint "%n %p (%c)%lBluetooth Audio %s"

Note the newline in this default.

``bluealsa-autoconfig`` reads the definition of this key only once, on startup.
So the program will have to be re-started after editing this key before any
change takes effect. The key should be defined in a system-wide configuration
file, it will not be read from a user's ``~/.asoundrc`` file. It is recommended
to use ``/etc/asound.conf`` for this purpose.

BLUETOOTH DEFAULT
=================

BlueALSA defines a default Bluetooth PCM, using the address
`00:00:00:00:00:00`, which selects the most recently connected device.
`bluealsa-autoconfig` creates a namehint for this PCM whenever at least one
Bluetooth audio device is connected. The name used is "bluealsa" and the
description is simply "Bluetooth Audio". For example:
::

    $ aplay -L
    bluealsa
        Bluetooth Audio

This namehint can be disabled for
any user by adding this definition to the ``~/.asoundrc`` file:
::

    bluealsa.pcm.hint.show off

The text used in the namehint is taken from the BlueALSA configuration which
can be changed for each user by adding this definition to ``~/.asoundrc``:
::

    pcm.bluealsa.hint.description "My new bluealsa description"


AUTOMATIC DEFAULT
=================

``bluealsa-autoconfig`` can optionally create an ALSA PCM definition suitable
for use as the user's ``default`` PCM. When enabled with the ``--default``
option, a user can choose to have the most recently connected BlueALSA device
as the ``default`` PCM by overriding the default in the ``~/.asoundrc`` file
as:
::

    pcm.!default bluealsa.pcm.default

The definition of this PCM varies according to whether any BlueALSA devices
are connected and which profiles and stream directions they provide. It will
"fallback" to the system default, or a PCM of the user's choosing, if no
matching BlueALSA PCM is currently connected. If more than one BlueALSA device
is available, then the most recently connected is chosen.

Note that this PCM does not re-direct a stream while in use - an application
will use the definition in place at the time it opens the PCM, and must close
that PCM then re-open the ``default`` to see any changes.

Five user-definable keys are provided to permit per-user customization of the
default behaviour. A user can define these in the ``~/.asoundrc`` file.

defaults.bluealsa.default.profile
    This key determines the profile that will be used for the ALSA ``default``
    PCM. It defaults to ``defaults.bluealsa.profile`` - i.e. it uses the same
    value as the ``bluealsa`` PCM default. If, for some reason, the user
    requires the profile for ``pcm.default`` to be different from the one for
    ``pcm.bluealsa``, then the above key can be used. Permitted values
    are ``a2dp`` ``asha`` or ``sco``.

defaults.bluealsa.default.stream
    This key determines which stream direction(s) are assigned to BlueALSA PCMs
    for the ``default`` PCM. Permitted values are ``capture``, ``playback`` or
    ``duplex``. The default is ``duplex``, which will use BlueALSA for both
    directions if both are available, or just one if only one is available.
    Note that A2DP streams (except SBC ``faststream``) generally have only one
    direction.

defaults.bluealsa.default.pcm.fallback
    This key determines which PCM will be used as a fallback for whichever
    stream direction(s) is/are not available as connected BlueALSA PCMs. For
    example to use the second soundcard with its default setup:
    ::

        defaults.bluealsa.default.pcm.fallback "sysdefault:CARD=1"

    The default value is ``sysdefault`` which is normally the system-defined
    default.

defaults.bluealsa.default.pcm.description
    The hint description to be used by the ``default`` PCM when it is a
    BlueALSA PCM. By default the description is
    "Default PCM device (currently BlueALSA)"

defaults.bluealsa.default.pcm.fallback_description
    The hint description to be used by the ``default`` PCM when it is not a
    BlueALSA PCM. By default the description is
    "Default PCM device"

When used with ``alsa-lib`` release 1.2.5 or later, ``bluealsa-autoconfig``
also creates a ALSA CTL suitable for use as a user's default mixer. This CTL is
a ``single-device`` mixer (except in one case, see below), and contains
controls for the ``bluealsa.pcm.default`` PCM also created by this option. To
use this CTL, a user must override the default in the ``~/.asoundrc`` file as:
::

    ctl.!default bluealsa.ctl.default

``alsa-lib`` does not support ``asym`` type CTLs, so it is not possible to have
a single mixer that has controls from different devices for capture and
playback. Therefore if this default CTL is selected it is not possible to have
the system default controls for capture combined with the BlueALSA controls for
playback.

In the case that both playback and capture BlueALSA PCMs are connected, but
from different devices, then the mixer ``bluealsa.ctl.default`` will be in its
default mode, and will show controls for **all** connected BlueALSA devices.
See ``bluealsa-plugins(7)`` for more information on BlueALSA CTL default and
single-device modes.

Three user-definable keys are provided to permit per-user customization of the
default behaviour. A user can define these in the ``~/.asoundrc`` file.

defaults.bluealsa.default.ctl.fallback
    This key determines which CTL will be used as a fallback whenever
    ``pcm.default`` is not a BlueALSA PCM.
    For example to use the mixer on the second soundcard:
    ::

        defaults.bluealsa.default.ctl.fallback "sysdefault:CARD=1"

    The default value is ``sysdefault`` which is normally the system-defined
    default.

defaults.bluealsa.default.ctl.description
    The hint description to be used by the ``default`` CTL when it is a
    BlueALSA mixer. By default the description is
    "Default control device (currently BlueALSA)"

defaults.bluealsa.default.ctl.fallback_description
    The hint description to be used by the ``default`` CTL when it is not a
    BlueALSA mixer. By default the description is
    "Default control device"

UDEV EVENT
==========

ALSA libasound has no built-in mechanism for informing an application when a
sound card or other device supporting PCM or mixer devices is connected or
disconnected from the system. Therefore applications that require this
information must rely on signalling from some other source to obtain event
notification.

The Linux sound subsystem emits "change" event notifications via ``udev`` when
pcm and control devices appear and disappear from the ``/dev/snd`` device
directory. The Linux Bluetooth subsystem also emits ``udev`` events when
remote devices connect and disconnect, but these notifications are generated
**before** the Bluez `bluetoothd` daemon creates the relevant D-Bus objects
and informs BlueALSA of the new profile connections. Therefore they are not
useful to applications requiring notifications of changes to the ALSA
configuration. To address this issue ``bluealsa-autoconfig`` generates
synthesised sound system udev events when it has updated the ALSA
configuration in the file system so that applications relying on this method
are able to re-load their ALSA configurations from file when appropriate.

This udev event generation is done only when ``bluealsa-autoconfig`` is run
with the option ``--udev``. The event has to be associated with a real sound
card in order for the kernel to accept it; so this feature does not work on
systems with no sound cards attached. By default the event is associated with
card 0, but a user can override this by defining a key in the ALSA
configuration:
::

    defaults.bluealsa.udev_card 0

This key can be set to a numeric card id or to the name of the card, for
example:
::

    defaults.bluealsa.udev_card IQaudIODAC

The key should be defined in a system-wide configuration
file, it will not be read from a user's ``~/.asoundrc`` file. It is
recommended to use ``/etc/asound.conf`` for this purpose.

LIBASOUND VERSION DEPENDENCY
============================

ALSA ``alsa-lib`` introduced the use of ``/var/lib/alsa/conf.d/`` as a standard
directory for dynamically added configuration files in release ``1.2.5``.
From that release onward, the ALSA configuration will automatically include
definitions from all ``.conf`` files in that directory.

**bluealsa-autoconfig** uses that directory to store its dynamic configuration
definitions, so that **bluealsa** Bluetooth devices automatically appear to
ALSA applications.

For earlier ALSA libasound releases, that directory is not automatically read
by default, so it is necessary to explicitly inform libasound to read the
**bluealsa-autoconfig** configuration file. This can be achieved by adding an
``include`` directive to ``/etc/asound.conf``:
::

    </var/lib/alsa/conf.d/bluealsa-autoconfig.conf>

Note that it is an error if an included file does not exist, so it is necessary
to ensure that **bluealsa-autoconfig** is running before using any ALSA
applications when using the include method.
