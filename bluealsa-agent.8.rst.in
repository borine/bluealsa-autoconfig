BlueALSA event handler helper utility

:Version: @VERSION@

SYNOPSIS
========

**bluealsa-agent** [*OPTION*] ... *COMMAND*

DESCRIPTION
===========

**bluealsa-agent** is a simple daemon to invoke arbitrary commands in response
to BlueALSA PCM events.

OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help
    Output a usage message and exit.

-V, --version
    Output the version number and exit.

-B NAME, --dbus=NAME
    BlueALSA service name suffix. This option can be given more than once to
    add support for multiple ``bluealsad(8)`` service instances. The default
    service **org.bluealsa** is always included. For example, the following
    will respond to events from **org.bluealsa**, **org.bluealsa.sink** and
    **org.bluealsa.source**:
    ::

        bluealsa-agent -B sink -B source <PATH-TO-COMMAND>

    For more information see the ``--dbus`` option of the ``bluealsad(8)``
    service daemon.

-p PROFILE, --profile=PROFILE
    Invoke commands only for PCMs having profile *PROFILE*. *PROFILE* may be
    "a2dp" or "sco". The default is to invoke commands for both profiles.

-m MODE, --mode=MODE
    Invoke commands only for PCMs having mode *MODE*. *MODE* may be "sink" or
    "source". The default is to invoke commands for both modes.

-s, --status[=PROPLIST]
	Invoke the *COMMAND* also when the status of the given PCM properties
	changes. *PROPLIST* is a comma-separated list of property names. Permissible
	names are "Running", "SoftVolume" and "Delay". If *PROPLIST* is not given
	then only changes to the "Running" state are active. See COMMAND_ below.

COMMAND
=======

The COMMAND must be a full path, either to an executable file or to a directory
containing only executable files. The specified file(s) will be executed
whenever one of the following events is signalled by the BlueALSA D-Bus
service(s).

	* PCM added
	* PCM removed
	* PCM codec changed

and optionally if *--status* is used:

	* PCM status changed

If COMMAND is a directory then each file within the directory is executed, in
alphanumeric order, and **bluealsa-agent** waits for each file to complete
before starting the next; only one event at a time will be processed.
**bluealsa-agent** re-reads the directory on receipt of a SIGHUP signal.

If COMMAND is a file then **bluealsa-agent** does not wait for it to complete;
so it is possible that it may be invoked again by the next event before the
previous invocation has completed.

In either case each executable file is invoked by **bluealsa-agent** with two
arguments as:

    COMMAND *EVENT* *PCM-PATH*

where *EVENT* is one of ``add``, ``remove`` or ``update`` and *PCM-PATH* is the
D-Bus object path of the PCM associated with the event.

**bluealsa-agent** also sets environment variables to pass additional
information about the event to *COMMAND*.

These variables are set for all events:

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_ADDRESS``
    The Bluetooth address of the device as `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_ALSA_ID``
    The ALSA name for this PCM. For example
    ``bluealsa:DEV=00:11:22:33:44:55,PROFILE=A2DP``

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_CHANNELS``
    The number of audio channels, for example ``2`` for stereo, ``1`` for mono.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_CODEC``
    The used codec, for example ``SBC``, ``AAC``, or ``mSBC``. Note that for the
    ``HFP`` profile the codec may be unset when the PCM is added, but will be
    reported in an ``update`` event as soon as the codec is set.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_CODEC_CONFIG`` (where appropriate)
    The used codec configuration "blob" as a hexadecimal string.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_FORMAT``
    The audio sample format. For most codecs used by Bluetooth PCMs this is
    ``S16_LE``.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_MODE``
    The stream direction, either ``sink`` or ``source``

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_NAME``
    The ``alias`` of the device, for example ``"Jabra MOVE v2.3.0"``

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_PROFILE``
    The Bluetooth profile, for example ``A2DP`` or ``HFP``

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_RATE``
    The audio sample rate in frames per second, for example ``48000`` or
    ``16000``.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_SAMPLING``
    Deprecated synonym for ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_RATE``. Will be discontinued
    in a future release.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_SERVICE``
    The D-Bus well-known name of the BlueALSA service handling this PCM, for
    example ``org.bluealsa``.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_TRANSPORT``
    The Bluetooth transport role, for example ``A2DP-source`` or ``HFP-AG``.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_TRANSPORT_TYPE``
    The Bluetooth transport type, either ``A2DP`` or ``SCO``.

When *--status* is used, then additional environment variables are also set
for the "added" and "update" events as determined by the *PROPLIST*.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_RUNNING``
    ``true`` if the PCM is running (i.e. when the underlying Bluetooth transport
    is acquired and able to transfer audio samples), ``false`` otherwise.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_SOFTVOL``
    ``true`` when the BlueALSA "SoftVolume" property is enabled for this PCM.
    See ``bluealsad(8)`` for more information.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_CLIENT_DELAY``
    The current client delay adjustment, in units of 1/10 millisecond.

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_DELAY``
    The current delay, in units of 1/10 millisecond.

To identify which properties have changed in an "update" event, one other
environment variable is set:

  ``BLUEALSA_PCM_PROPERTY_CHANGES``
    A space-separated list indicating the changed properties, consisting of one
    or more from:

      CHANNELS

      CLIENT_DELAY

      CODEC

      CODEC_CONFIG

      DELAY

      FORMAT

      RUNNING

      RATE

      SOFTVOL

For compatibility with older versions, the word "SAMPLING" is also included
when the rate has changed. Use of this term is deprecated and will be
discontinued in a future release.

When the **bluealsa-agent** service is started it invokes the "PCM added" event
for all connected BlueALSA PCMs, and when it is stopped then it invokes the
"PCM removed" event for all connected BlueALSA PCMs.
